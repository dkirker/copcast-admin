# Copcast Admin

Copcast Admin is part of the Copcast solution to help improve police accountability using mobile phones to record the video and the audio and register their GPS location.

Copcast Admin is developed with <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>

## Installation

First, install <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> in your development machine. We are using, currently, version <b>0.10.40</b>.

With node installed, install Bower, Gulp, Karma and PhantomJs (the last two, to run the tests). And then, run npm install and bower install for the packages in the root of the project.

```
  npm install -g bower
  npm install -g gulp
  npm install -g karma
  npm install phantomjs
  
  npm install
  bower install
```
Now you have Copcast Admin installed. To connect it with the server, you must have installed <a href="https://github.com/igarape/mogi-server">Copcast Server</a>. If you did not install it yet, this is the time!

To connect Copcast Admin with the server, you must create a <b>config.js</b> file inside the directory <b>src/app</b> and include the folowing line

```
angular.module('copcastAdminApp').constant('ServerUrl', '<SERVER URL>');
```
<b>IMPORTANT:</b>
we user cookie's validation to guarantee that all requests are authenticated (even requests straigth from the HTML). The domain of Copcast Server must be the same from Copcast Admin.

Now finally run the app:

```
  gulp copy-bs-fonts
  gulp serve
```

or

```
  gulp server
```


## Deployment

_Gulp_ is not suited for the production environment and you should use a real web server for the task, like _Apache_ or _Nginx_.
Once you have configured your web server, you can instruct _gulp_ to build your files with:

```
  gulp build
```

The generated files will be deployed to the _dist_ directory, which should serve as your web root.

If you want to have your service running under HTTPS, configure your web server as usual and do not forget to omit the schema part from the _ServerUrl_.


To test copcast completely, you must have also the <a href="https://github.com/igarape/copcast-android">Copcast Android</a> app installed in an Android phone and connected to the <a href="https://github.com/igarape/mogi-server">Copcast Server</a>.
